# Attention please

This is my test task SPA on React+MobX+TS stack. 

I decided not to create any .env files because security is not an important option in this case

I tried to create a scalable DDD structure, so it maybe seems to be complicated, but it will be easier to support
and develop in future

I have also created some comments in tricky parts of code.

### For application starting:

1) Install dependencies 
```bash
npm install
```
2) Start the project
```bash
npm start
```

I hope you will enjoy my app!
